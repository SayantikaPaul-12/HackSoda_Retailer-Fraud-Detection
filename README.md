# HackSoda_Retailer-Fraud-Detection
Our project uses the Mistral-large-latest LLM model on an AWS EC2 instance to help eCommerce sellers like Amazon (FBA) detect fraudulent manufacturers and wholesalers, especially in remote locations. Built in Streamlit with Python, it ensures safer purchases for customers and allows sellers to make informed sourcing decisions.
